## 1. Modernize Python Syntax and Structure (High Priority)
- [x] Convert to Python 3 syntax
- [x] Replace relative imports with absolute imports
- [x] Add type hints to all functions and methods
- [x] Define `__all__` in each module for better import control
- [x] Update string handling to use consistent quotes (preferably double quotes)
- [x] Replace `iteritems()` with `items()` for dictionary iteration
- [x] Add proper docstrings in Google or NumPy format

## 2. Improve Error Handling and Exception Framework (High Priority)
- [x] Create a custom base exception class (e.g., `OpenfireApiException`)
- [x] Make all existing exceptions inherit from the base exception
- [x] Replace bare `except:` clauses with specific exception handling
- [x] Add context information to exceptions
- [ ] Implement proper logging throughout the codebase
- [ ] Add timeout handling for API requests
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures

## 3. Enhance Security Features (High Priority)
- [x] Add configurable SSL certificate validation for API requests (with option to disable for self-signed certs)
- [ ] Implement secure handling of credentials from environment variables or config files
- [ ] Remove credentials.txt from the repository and add to .gitignore
- [ ] Add input validation to prevent injection attacks
- [ ] Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- [ ] Support both shared secret and token-based authentication
- [ ] Create a secure credential storage mechanism with encryption

## 4. Refactor Duplicated Code (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Extract common API request patterns into shared utilities
- [ ] Break down large methods into smaller, more focused ones
- [ ] Implement parameter objects for methods with many parameters
- [ ] Create utility functions for common operations
- [ ] Standardize parameter naming across modules
- [ ] Implement consistent return value handling

## 5. Add Comprehensive Test Suite (High Priority)
- [x] Set up pytest framework with minimal dependencies
- [x] Create unit tests for each module
- [x] Add integration tests using the local test server (http://localhost:9090 and https://localhost:9091)
- [x] Create test configuration to use credentials from credentials.txt for local testing only
- [x] Add tests for both certificate validation and non-validation modes
- [x] Verify read operations (90% passing)
- [ ] Fix write operations tests
- [ ] Set up test coverage reporting
- [x] Create test fixtures and factories
- [ ] Add CI/CD configuration for automated testing

## 6. Update Documentation (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Create a comprehensive API reference
- [x] Add examples for each module
- [x] Document security best practices
- [x] Create integration examples with real Openfire servers
- [x] Update README with more detailed installation and usage instructions
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation for utility scripts
- [ ] Add contributing guidelines
- [ ] Create changelog and versioning documentation

## 7. Implement Modern Package Management with mise and uv (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Create pyproject.toml for modern packaging with minimal dependencies
- [ ] Configure dependency management with uv through mise
- [ ] Update mise.toml with appropriate tool versions and settings
- [ ] Ensure virtual environment management is properly configured in mise.toml
- [ ] Separate core dependencies from optional/development dependencies
- [ ] Create proper package distribution configuration
- [ ] Set up version management
- [ ] Document mise and uv workflows for contributors

## 8. Add New Features (Low Priority)
- [ ] Implement async/await support for non-blocking operations
- [ ] Add pagination support for large datasets
- [ ] Create connection pooling for better performance
- [ ] Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Add support for webhooks
- [ ] Create high-level convenience methods for common operations
- [ ] Add support for bulk operations

## 9. Command-Line Utilities (Completed)
- [x] Create `list_users.py` script for listing Openfire users
- [x] Create `list_muc.py` script for listing MUC rooms with user information
- [x] Create `export_users_for_elasticsearch.py` script for Elasticsearch integration
- [x] Create `export_muc_for_elasticsearch.py` script for Elasticsearch integration
- [x] Add comprehensive documentation for all scripts
- [x] Support multiple output formats (table, JSON, CSV)
- [x] Add SSL verification options for all scripts
